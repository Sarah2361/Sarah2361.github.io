## Author 
Sarah Cornehls is a writer from Melbourne. She mostly focuese on fiction - such as contemporary fiction, romance, and the occasional sci-fi piece. She also writes some non fiction such as memoir and reports. Sarah previously studied music, so her works often tend to merge music with literature, as they both fall under the arts. 

Sarah's background in music is classical training, and she blends music terms into her literature works and draws on similarities between the two.
